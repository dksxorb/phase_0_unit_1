// I worked [by myself] on this challenge

// Your mission description:
// You(Tharin) find yourself captured by the ogre horde and thrown in one of their prison cells. The majority of the ogres all 
// left to do battle with the rest of your combat mates and only one unhappy ogre guard is there to stand watch.
// There appears to be an iron pipe in the right corner of the cell. Silly ogres didn't even notice it when they threw
// you in there. You're very aware of the fact that ogres are particularly sensitive creatures especially when it comes
// to their mothers. Taunt the ogre and talk about his mother. Taunt him enough so that he opens the door to the cell
// in a fit of rage to beat you up. Take that chance to knock him unconscious with the iron pipe and escape from the dungeon.
// 
// 

// Pseudocode
// Size of the dungeon 5x6. Size of the cell 5x4. 
// Move Tharin near pipe location (5,6)
// Tharin picks up pipe when he steps near the pipe
// Move Tharin close to cell door
// Taunt Ogre with any string that contains Mother
// Ogre moves to door (2,2)
// Ogre opens door
// Tharin hits ogre
// Ogre goes unconscious
// Move Tharin Down
// Move Tharin Right to the exit

// Initial Code

var tharin = {};
var ogre = {};
var pipe = {};





// Refactored Code






// Reflection
// I had a surprisingly difficult time trying to code this mission. It was a fairly simple mission. You send Tharin to get
// a pipe in a certain location. Then you go near the door, taunt the guard, hit the guard and run away. Who knew that 
// trying to code such simple actions would take such a long time. I don't think I am comfortable enough with my JavaScript
// to fully manipulate the code for developing my mission. I did extensive research for javascript, but I also think I 
// made the mistake of underestimating how large of a project it would be. Even the smallest of project would take a lot
//  more hours than necessary. I had fun thinking up the game and writing the pseudocode but when it came down to the 
// nitty-gritty coding it was very difficult. I'm going to have to come back to this challenge to finish up what I started
// and to continue my application of the JavaScript that I learned. It was fun but extremely difficult. I should've accounted 
// for more time for this challenge.
