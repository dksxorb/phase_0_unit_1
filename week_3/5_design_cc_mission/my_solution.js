// I worked [by myself] on this challenge

// Your mission description:
// You(Tharin) find yourself captured by the ogre horde and thrown in one of their prison cells. The majority of the ogres all 
// left to do battle with the rest of your combat mates and only one unhappy ogre guard is there to stand watch.
// There appears to be an iron pipe in the right corner of the cell. Silly ogres didn't even notice it when they threw
// you in there. You're very aware of the fact that ogres are particularly sensitive creatures especially when it comes
// to their mothers. Taunt the ogre and talk about his mother. Taunt him enough so that he opens the door to the cell
// in a fit of rage to beat you up. Take that chance to knock him unconscious with the iron pipe and escape from the dungeon.
//
