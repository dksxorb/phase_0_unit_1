// 6. REFLECTION

// Jonathan and I both discussed how our days were and we got caught up so that we could find the right pace to work at.
// We both agreed to switch driver and navigator roles and I started off as the navigator. Jonathan followed my navigations
// with a great deal of patience and he would give me some recommendations as to which decisions we should make when it came
// to coding the required material. We worked well together and we had a very good energy going that kept our conversations
// engaged and our work efficient. When we did happen to come upon a problem (which was when we had to store a function within
// and object) we decided to take a couple of minutes to ourselves to review some of our material and come back and converse
// and work out the problem together. I really think the GPS session helped me gain a better understanding of Javascript concepts.
// John Norton was our advisor and he would answer with great detail our questions when we were confused but he also knew when
// to keep quiet so that my parter and I could work. He was really helpful and he provided a great deal of insight into the world 
// of DBC. I finally learned how to work my javascript code through a text editor (sublime) and then through node. I solidified what
// console.log did and how to read the results from my coding. I felt a great deal more confident then I did when I was doing 
// previous exercises, partly due to the fact that I had a good peer partner/advisor and partly because I had somewhat of a better handle
// on javascript concepts compared to earlier in the week. I really enjoyed working on the project all around, from the planning,
// to the coding. I really didn't find anything tedious because my partner and I would switch driver/navigator positions
// and we would have our own opinions and inputs that made the whole experience engaging and fun.
