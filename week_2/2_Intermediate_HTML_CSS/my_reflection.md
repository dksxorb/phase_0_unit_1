# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
<br> 
I think web standards are good in terms of streamlining the internet and preventing too many errors. It's a good way to make sure that everything will work the way that it should and the basic needs of the people are met. It also means that everyone can learn the standards and follow them. It's a way of making a uniform language that everybody can learn and converse with one another. The only bad thing would be that there wouldn't be as much variety in terms of webpages or designs, etc...
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
<br>
Yes the standard structure makes sense. It's like a tree with many different branches. Although there might be many branches as long as the tree is organized everything can be traced back to the root.
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
<br>
I really like the new HTML5 elements. Personally they make more sense than the divs and it makes labeling things alot more easier. It allows me to compartmentalize the sections of my code and that helps when I try to fix code or create more code.
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
<br>
Since there are so many different technology and browsers that access a particular website, there are all different representations of the information and some browsers may not show the site the way the developer needs it to be. So the reset.css kinda sets everything to a generally consistent baseline. It basically resets everything so the developer can take the basic data and style it the way he/she needs.
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
<br>
I've used Internet Explorer, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome. And yes I've noticed that not all sites look the same in different browsers, or at least it was noticeably different a couple of years ago. I have mixed feelings about it. Everyone has a preference for how things are laid out in the internet but from the perspective of a person who's leisurely scouring the internet its not that big of a deal. For people who use the web for more intense and specific purposes I can't really say. The web is a good representation of the world because there are so many different people and locations. I like the variety because it gives the web some spice. 
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
<br>
My resources were the people in my cohort. They all post good sites and information that pertains to the curriculum. I hope to do the same.
