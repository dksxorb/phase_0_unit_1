# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
<br>
Responsive web design is web designing with the mentality that there is not much that the web developer/designer can control except their own code. It's designing with the intent to make the web site more fluid and adaptive. I think it's a good practice because given the variety of browsers and media technology, a website shouldn't be fixed to one web design for one type of browser, that's not an effective way of presenting information. 
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
<br>
Smartphones and tablets have presented a problem to web designers/developers of how to effectively/aesthetically present information. It's also given developers a new perspective on how to think for user experience. It expands the world of web developing/designing. It definitely increases the workload but it also makes for interesting developments. New technology will continue to expand the world of web desing/development. There'll be new ways to streamline presentation and code.  
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
<br>
Visually impaired people need to use the web via the other 5 senses - Smell, Taste, Touch, and Hearing. I don't know if there any methods for impaired persons to engage with the internet in such a manner but it would be an extremely cool project. The internet has been mainly developed for the users to interact via sight but that doesn't mean other senses can't be a medium. I think designing and developing for visually impaired people can enhance the user web experience even for those that aren't visually impaired. It's almost as if the human is creating a way to fully integrate with machines.  
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
<br>
I really like the idea of a responsive web design. It just makes everything so much prettier and fluid. I love how all the methods that were used to create and set webpages in the past help to develop the new ones. Honestly, what doesn't make sense is why people are still using older browsers and not the newer ones. What's stopping people from transitioning into the newer browsers so that webpages can all have a somewhat uniform language.   
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
