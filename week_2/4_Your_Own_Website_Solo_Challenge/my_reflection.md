Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
<br>
Sometimes it's really difficult meshing design and user experience together. They don't always work with one another. The design can get in the way of the user experience. There's an art to making something tremdously tasteful and cool and finding a way for it to simplify a users experience.
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
<br>
Honestly it was pretty difficult. The wireframe I prefer to do on paper. But it was fun trying out new design concepts.
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
<br>
I drew up the wireframe after I thought up what I wanted for the site. I coded the basic skeleton. I then tried to implement parts of the css to the barebones html. I think it was a very slow process for me to use sublime then commit those changes and then push it up each time. I couldn't find a decent generator that could really show me what I was coding. That was slightly frustrating.
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
<br>
There's alot I need to work on for my site. I just didn't have the time to fully implement everything.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
<br>
Yes. Given some of the time constraint I had this week it was difficult to fully delve deeply into applying the things that I've learned. I feel as though I spent too much time studying up on something rather than applying it. It was my fault for getting to into the learning part. I did think the jumping from one section of the page to the next was pretty cool.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
<br>
My own cohorts were resource enough to help me better understand a topic.
