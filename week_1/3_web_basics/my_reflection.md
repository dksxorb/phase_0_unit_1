## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please lis

*The web is not the internet. I thought that the world wide web was the network where all the computers in the world were connected. That web is actually an information sharing application that sits on top of the internet. It's what allows you to interact with web pages through a web browser. I also learned that the web is just a bunch of code that the web browser takes when it requests a web page from a server and represents in the pretty format that we see presently.
*A site should have valid html, css, and javascript. It should meet accessibility standards and semantic guidelines, and have valid meta data and proper character encoding. One should question what the purpose of the site is before building it and whether they should build it themsleves or hire someone else. When they decide to build a site they should register their domain name and make sure to have someone host that domain.
*It felt very cool. It's always nice to see the physical work that you've been theoretically working out in your head.
*The biggest concepts that solidified were how the web browser/server worked and how domain names and ip addresses worked. These were all concepts that were new to me, yet they made sense because of how technology and the internet had been integrated into my lifestyle. 
*All the provided material was sufficient in helping futher my understanding of the following curriculum.
