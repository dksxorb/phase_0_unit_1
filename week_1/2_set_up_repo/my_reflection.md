## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

*First you log into your GitHub account. Then on your accounts main page you click the tab that says "repositories". You'll see a button that says New. This is the button that'll allow you to create a new repository. Click the button. Then you fill out the new repository form: name the repository what you'd like, make it public or private, initialize the repository with a README and add a license (most likely a MIT License). Once you've filled out the form you click the "create repository" button and you've created a repository. To clone the repository make sure you have the GitHub app downloaded onto your computer. Once you've downloaded the app, open the program and find the search bar. Type the name of your repository into the search bar. Once you've found the repository from the list there'll be a "clone to computer" button on the side. Click the button and you have know cloned the repository to your computer.
*Open source means sharing how a program was made and allowing anyone to customize the program as they see fit.
*I think Open Source is an amazing concept. It's kinda like the wild west or the ocean. It makes me feel both nervous and protected because there are so many different people with different agendas on the internet and if you don't understand the world of the internet it can be a little daunting. Open Source definitely feels like a utopia. It has a utopian mindset of creating the perfect world but in my opinion utopias fail because of the diversity of people. Open Source is freedom but with freedom comes many variables, and variables aren't necessarily catered to benefit every individual.
*Licenses are very important. They protect you and they give you power to move around the world of coding. I think its extremely important to be well aware of what licenses can do for you and also what licenses prevent you from doing. 
*The concept of open source and licensing was solidified in the challenge. My "aha" moment was just how open source and licensing really changed the world. I could say it hurt the world but it also helped the world. I didn't really struggle with anything so far. I just need to deepen my understanding of how far licensing can go.
*All the resources I've used so far have been the ones DBC has provided.
