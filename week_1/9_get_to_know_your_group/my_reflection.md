Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

A lot of people were scared, nervous, apprehensive, and excited for DBC. It made me feel closer to all these people. It's generally what I've been feeling the moment I applied to DBC. My experience this week solidified alot of the expectations that I had about DBC. I knew the workload was gonna be heavy. But strangely I feel fulfilled having done all this work. It literally feels like college finals week since the work started. I'm more impressed by the people who are working and finishing their work. Granted I had an extremely busy week but I'm not working and I find myself sweating to finish the exercises sometimes. The course is extremely immersive and I have to be careful not to drown and to keep myself in pace with the waves of work that come. I'm a little more prepared for what's to come. It's exciting and nervewracking but I know that I'm not the only one feeling this way.
