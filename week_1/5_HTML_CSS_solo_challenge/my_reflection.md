## 5. [HTML/CSS Solo Challenge](5_HTML_CSS_solo_challenge/readme.md) Reflection

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

*The first question I asked myself was what kind of website did I want to design. The second question I asked was what content would make the website. These were all questions that I had to resolve by myself. When I started designing the website the main questions were how I would position everything especially the div sections. I had to look around codecademy and the provided links to get a decent grasp on how to move my div sections around and part them so that they looked decent enough. 
*I'm having difficulty finding the right section sizes to use (px wise) so that I can speed up my developing. Positioning and Floating are still uncomfortable for me. It takes a bit of time for me to get the placement that I prefer. I was having problems placing an absolute text over my image for some reason. But I realized I had my image nested in my <p> tag so it was moving with my text. I moved my image into the <div> that the <p> was under and it solved my problem.
*I learned how to round the edges of my rectangles to make the design look softer and nicer. I also learned a:hover which is pretty cool.
*So far the Learning competencies have been alright. It's not too difficult, but it isn't necessarily a walk in the park. It's just that there's load of information to digest and then apply to make a tangible result. Overall I'm having fun but I wish I could be a little quicker with my coding.
*I enjoy the whole watching the website unfold part of coding. It's nice to see all that hard work actually turning into something. Of course learning new things to make websites even more awesome is fun too. 
*Coding in itself is a pretty tedious task, but, like i said, it's awesome seeing the end result. And practice makes perfect. I'd rather have tedium and the muscle-memory that comes along with it than nothing at all.
