## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* To be honest. Html is a pretty straightforward concept. Everything up til now makes sense. There isn't much so far that doesn't make sense about HTML. Maybe if things start to become more advanced html will get a little more confusing. But so far so good.
* HTML is very straightforward which makes learning the language pretty simple. It's all a matter of practice and creativity. In any language people can get their point across with basic vocabulary but also find a plethora of ways to get the same idea across with different verbage. It's all up to the creator. Personally I like html. So I haven't really thought anything bad about it.
* One aha moment I had was when I had to link the css to the html file. 
* Codecademy.com was a good resource to review my html and css knowledge
