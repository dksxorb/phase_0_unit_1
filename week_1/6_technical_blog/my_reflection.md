Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

The process was surprisingly long and tedious. There were times when it was fun but I realized my choice in colors aren't as good as I thought they'd be. I had a longer time deciding what colors to choose for my blog post then how I'd create the skeleton that made the website. I did enjoy the final outcome of this whole process. I felt pretty good overall. Nothing really stood out aside from the fact that my basics were starting to come together. I had some problems pushing the website online, but that was just internally I didn't connect the folders right and save the files within the right folders so GitHub could locate it and activate it. Overall: Not too bad.
